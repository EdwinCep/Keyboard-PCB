# Keyboard Layout
First we should propably have an idea of what we want our final product should look like. Luckily the website [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) (KLE) helps us map out how we want our keyboard to look. With KLE we can move keys around, reshape them, delete them, and even rename and color them.

This is what I decided on.

**Somethings to note are:** 
- SAVE THE RAW DATA!!! If you close the tab and didnt create an account to save the layout it will be deleted and youll have to redo it :(
- If you scroll down under properties you can see the height and width of the key selected which will be important later.
- The summary tab is useful to know if your on the right track with the schematic step aswell.
- If you plan on using a plate and dont want to design your own stick with a standard setup same thing goes for key sizes.
