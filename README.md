# Creating A Keyboard PCB 
This repositorty will be a small walkthrough of me creating my first PCB.

The goal of this project is to pick up skills involved in the PCB creation process and hopefully order some PCBs to obtain some soldering experience while soldering the switches on.

# Steps 
1. Decide on a Keyboard Layout.
2. Create a circuit diagram of the keyboards components.
3. Using this circuit diagram layout your components on a PCB editor.
4. Send the PCB design out to be made.
