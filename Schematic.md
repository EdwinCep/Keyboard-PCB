# Creating the basic schematic
Now we start the more complex part creating the schematic for our project. This is where we lay down the circuit components and their connections.

This is where KiCad comes in. KiCad is a free open source application with a schematic editor that allows you to plan out circuits that we can then transport into the built in PCB editor. You can download [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) on any OS. KiCad can be a little confusing to work with luckily since KiCad 7.0 was just released I found a very helpful youtube channel posting a guide on how to use KiCad 7.0.[PCB Cupid](https://www.youtube.com/@pcbcupid/videos) After the first couple of videos I was able to more easily move around KiCad.
